## ðŸ“„ Acceptance Criteria Implemented

- **AC01**: Two routes created:

  - `/products`: Displays list of products
  - `/cart`: Displays cart contents

- **AC02**: Product page:

  - Fetches and lists products from the provided API
  - Enables adding a valid amount of each product to the cart (with respect to `minOrderAmount`)
  - Prevents adding more than the available amount

- **AC03**: Cart page:
  - Displays total quantity and total price of added products

## ðŸ“„ Additional Notes

- To address duplicate IDs in the API data, I introduced a remapping utility that guarantees each product has a unique ID before rendering.
- Due to limited time, fallback support for a missing image was not included in this version.
- Error handling is basic and would require improvements for a production-grade application.
- Amount validation is currently enforced only through button disablement in the UI. Due to time constraints, server-side or method-level validation has not been implemented, which means the logic could be bypassed via browser developer tools.
